                <h2>About our History</h2>
                <p>The archetype for all other modern banquet halls and wedding venues, Tryst has developed into a venerable cornerstone in the Los Angeles community.From its star-studded corporate events and opulent wedding celebrations to the venue's integral involvement in local charitable organizations, Tryst is unmatched in elegance, ambiance, and integrity. Located in the heart of Hollywood, Tryst offers far more than a breathtaking backdrop for Southern California's most noteworthy entertainment events, fashion shows, and political ceremonies; though the venueâ€™s beautiful European-inspired decor and custom-made 5,000 square-foot stained glass ceiling never fail to leave guests speechless,Tryst contributions to the community are equally as impressive as the formal celebrations that take place within its iron gates and stately limestone exterior. Since its opening in 2015, the venue has worked tirelessly with numerous charities to improve the lives of those in need and has been recognized by city, state, and national publications for both its philanthropic works and its excellence as an event venue.</p>
